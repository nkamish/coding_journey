            <li>CSS</li>

        <p>HTML being the structure of my website. This allows me to add my content to the webpage. Using HTML, I have been able to not just apply the content to my website, I am also able to provide "structure" or a layout. This would be the foundation of my website.</p>

        <p>CSS allows me to add numerous amount of styles to my website. This allows me to explore my creativity and play around with many options with styling.</p>

        <p>Responsive Designs enables me to scale my website so that it can look presentable on many platforms. (Mobile phones, laptops, etc.)</p>
